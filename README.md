Jest Test Suite for Utility Functions
This repository contains a set of unit tests written in JavaScript using the Jest framework. The tests are designed to validate the functionality of various utility functions and data structures defined in the main module.

Overview
The test suite includes:

Even Number Functionality:

Tests for the even function to ensure it correctly identifies even and odd numbers, including edge cases such as negative numbers.
Variable Validation:

Checks for variable states, confirming whether they are defined, undefined, or null.
Ensures that defined variables do not equal null.
Array Content Validation:

Validates the presence of specific elements in predefined arrays, such as verifying that 'cat' exists in the animals array and checking for the presence of the number 5 in the arr_num array.
Tests Included
Even Function Tests:

Validates outputs for various integers (e.g., 4, 5, 6, -2, -3).
Variable State Tests:

Checks for undefined, defined, and null states of variables.
Array Tests:
Verifies specific contents in the animals and arr_num arrays.
